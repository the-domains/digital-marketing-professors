****

**Where are you from?**

I was Born in Kuwait, Raised in Jordan and originally from Palestine.
I hold a Jordanian passport, but I think of these three countries as my
hometown.

**What do you do for a living?**

I work as a copywriter/digital marketer at [New Arab Media][0], whose mission is to unlock Arab creativity and tell stories that represent the heritage and real identities of our users.

**What's a fun fact about you? **

I have a drawer in my desk at work which is full of chocolate and 
chips, Everyone in the company keeps making jokes about how I could open
a supermarket with these things, and what's more fun is that I can 
finish them all in one day, so yeah I love Chocolate.

**What would your dream job look like?**

It would look like me sitting in a big office with a nametag written on the Desk "Head of Media".

**Why did you decide to start the Digital Marketing specialization?**

Well, I wanted to learn digital marketing like ages before, and I 
took so many courses and stuff but not one of them was as much 
beneficial as this course. I started working as a digital marketer but 
did not have enough experience to fully handle all the stuff, so my 
company suggested that I would take this course to learn and grow, and I
am so grateful that I did.

**What has been the most interesting thing you've learned through the course you are on?**

Well, since I am still in the first course, I would say that learning
about the 4 Ps of marketing was really both great and fun. There are 
many things that I did not know before, and now I feel like I am more 
confident when it comes to this subject.

**Have you gotten a chance to apply Digital Marketing concepts in your daily life?**

No Yet, I'm hoping I will soon get the chance to apply what I learn 
in my work which is the reason why I took the course from the first 
place.

**How do you plan your schedule to make time for Digital Marketing courses?**

Well, I take one hour from my working hours to finish the course, and
sometimes I do the assignments on the weekend because they have a 
specific deadlines.

**Do you have any advice for new learners or for those who may be unsure about starting the specialization?**

Well, I would really recommend this course to anyone whose passion is
to be a professional digital marketer, and let them know that this 
course needs focus, hard work and dedication.
